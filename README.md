# User-Generated Service
This is a high-load user-generated service built using FastAPI and utilizing a microservices architecture with Apache Kafka for event streaming, ClickHouse for movie watching history storage, and MongoDB for storing user reviews, likes, and movie bookmarks. The service offers a RESTful API and is designed for high-performance and scalability to handle large amounts of data and traffic. It features an easy-to-use RESTful API and is designed to handle large amounts of data and traffic, making it suitable for high-performance and scalable applications. Additionally, it offers advanced monitoring and logging capabilities, using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for centralized logging and data analysis, and easy integration with other systems and services to ensure smooth performance under high loads.
